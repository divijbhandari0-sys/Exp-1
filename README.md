Aim : Introduction to python 
Theory : inputing elements, displaying data types, mathematical operation in two integers, area of circle, log value, sin value, checking which element is greater.
int makes and integer value.
to use pi and log we use import math.
float is used to store decimals.

Algorithm--------
calculator:
Start.
Prompt the user to enter a value for a and convert it to an integer.
Prompt the user to enter a value for b and convert it to an integer.
Calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
Print the formatted results.
Stop.

comarision of two numbers:
Start.
Initialize a=10 and b=5 (or take these as input from the user).
If a is greater than b:
Print "b is less than a".
Else:
Print "b is greater than a".
Stop.

area of circle:
Start.
Import the math module.
Prompt the user to enter the radius r and convert it to a float.
Calculate the area using the formula: Area = pi*r*r (using math.pi).
Print the calculated area.
Stop.

Conclusion : Hence the codes for calculator, area of circle and comparision of two numbers are successfully executed.
